                    <h2>INTRO</h2>
                    <p class="summuary">
                        This project has evolved and gotten improved a lot since I first delivered it. I have added a lot of JS and the design and technical bit have gotten more semantic and appealing for the users. On the design point of view this is my favorite outcome of all the projects and design we have done this year. It is just a smooth and neat color choice design. Obviously there has been some work through the whole year on this project because we worked on it on the Interaction Design CA, but I started with reding through my feedback I got from the first assignment on this project and worked from there.

                    <h2>Design</h2>
                    <p>The first thing I added to my website was a CTA on the frontpage because I got feedback that a CTA was missing and needed to be added. I added two CTA´s one that took the users to the man´s section and the other to the women´s section. This was to make it easier for the users to navigate through the website. </p>
                    <p>Next up I did some changes in the design on links, especially on the homepage. I added I nice hovering animation on the navigation links to make the design more pleasing for the users. I also changed the shadows on the jackets to a filter so that the shadow is around the jacket and not a box-shadow I had. </p>

                    <h2>JS</h2>
                    <p>I added some js to the contact and checkout part. Just some easy form valitadtion.</p>
                    <div class="js">
                        <p>I also fixed the js on the detailspage. I learned to use the api better on the exam project so fixed it on this project and made i nice and neat.</p>
