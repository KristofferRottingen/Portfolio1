                    <p class="summuary">  
                        On this project I dint have any js so I had to add some js to the website. It is a website about a science museum where our goal was to get the viewers to visit the museum. I feel that. This project did work out very well and ended up nice and neat with the new changes.
                    </p>
                    <div class="line"></div>
                    <h2>Design</h2>
                    <p>In the beginning I start looking at my feedback where I stood that the logo text line was a bit smaller than the logo and got a bit “hidden”. So, I fixed the logo.  Then the next problem was that the nav elements on mobile was a bit close to the logo, so I gave the logo some air to breathe in.</p>
                    <div class="csm_logo">
                        <img src="images/csm-logo.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <div class="line"></div>
                    <h2>JS</h2>
                    <p>For the JS part on this website a made a details page. I had to make all the exhibitions spaces links. I used a query string on the links to get the param so I could get details from an API that I made for this website. I also made the news section links so them also could go into the details page. Other than that I made some small media quire changes.</p>
