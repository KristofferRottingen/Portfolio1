                    <p class="summuary">  
                        On this project I wanted challenge myself when it comes to the design. Usually when I design websites, I more often use a bitter bit of “boring” colour template. So, for this one I wanted to make it colourful and at the same time a delicate design. Given the instructions to make a blog site, the first thing that came to my mind was a food blog. I searched for blog pages to find some inspiration on the setup, and found out that blogs normally have a quite simple and boring design. That’s when I decided that I wanted to make the reading of any blog, in my example a food blog, a nice enjoyable experience for the users. Since my theme was food, I wanted to make the site look delicate and hypothetically, make the users hungry by visiting the blog.

                    <h2>Design</h2>
                    <p>My colour pallet came from when I made the logo. I really liked the yellow-ish from the burger on the top. A thing I always focus on when it comes to the design would be a “red line” through the whole design, and I like to start from the logo, so it makes consistence through the website.</p>

                    <h2>Changes</h2>
                    <p>For this project I didn’t make too many changes because I just work on it for 5 straight weeks so there wasn´t much to change. When I looked over it, I found out that the white background color didn´t fit so I changed it to the yellow color I got on my website.</p>
